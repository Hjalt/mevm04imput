  abstract =      {Objective Missing indicator method (MIM) and complete
                   case analysis (CC) are frequently used to handle
                   missing confounder data. Using empirical data, we
                   demonstrated the degree and direction of bias in the
                   effect estimate when using these methods compared
                   with multiple imputation (MI). Study Design and
                   Setting From a cohort study, we selected an exposure
                   (marital status), outcome (depression), and
                   confounders (age, sex, and income). Missing values in
                   {\textquotedblleft}income{\textquotedblright} were
                   created according to different patterns of
                   missingness: missing values were created completely
                   at random and depending on exposure and outcome
                   values. Percentages of missing values ranged from
                   2.5\% to 30\%. Results When missing values were
                   completely random, MIM gave an overestimation of the
                   odds ratio, whereas CC and MI gave unbiased results.
                   MIM and CC gave under- or overestimations when
                   missing values depended on observed values. Magnitude
                   and direction of bias depended on how the missing
                   values were related to exposure and outcome. Bias
                   increased with increasing percentage of missing
                   values. Conclusion MIM should not be used in handling
                   missing confounder data because it gives
                   unpredictable bias of the odds ratio even with small
                   percentages of missing values. CC can be used when
                   missing values are completely random, but it gives
                   loss of statistical power.},

  abstract =      {When fitting a generalized linear
                   model{\textemdash}such as linear regression, logistic
                   regression, or hierarchical linear
                   modeling{\textemdash}analysts often wonder how to
                   handle missing values of the dependent variable Y. If
                   missing values have been filled in using multiple
                   imputation, the usual advice is to use the imputed Y
                   values in analysis. We show, however, that using
                   imputed Ys can add needless noise to the estimates.
                   Better estimates can usually be obtained using a
                   modified strategy that we call multiple imputation,
                   then deletion (MID). Under MID, all cases are used
                   for imputation but, following imputation, cases with
                   imputed Y values are excluded from the analysis. When
                   there is something wrong with the imputed Y values,
                   MID protects the estimates from the problematic
                   imputations. And when the imputed Y values are
                   acceptable, MID usually offers somewhat more
                   efficient estimates than an ordinary MI strategy.},
